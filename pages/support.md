Double Union is supported entirely by donations, membership dues, and volunteers. We would love your support for our makerspace in San Francisco! We hope to serve as a role model and resource for other makerspaces and hackerspaces around the world.

### Make a donation

{% include donate.html %}

### Set up AmazonSmile

You can also set up [AmazonSmile](https://smile.amazon.com/) to automatically give Double Union 0.5% of the purchase price of your Amazon purchases (with some exceptions). When you visit AmazonSmile, it'll ask you to pick a non-profit organization. Search for "Double Union" and choose it!
