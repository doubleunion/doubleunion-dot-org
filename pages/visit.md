### Location

We are located in Lower Potrero Hill at [1250 Missouri St. #111](https://www.google.com/maps/place/1250+Missouri+St,+San+Francisco,+CA+94107/@37.7504873,-122.3978271,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x808f7fae0730e01b:0x8ee0ca3bde3eae0d), San Francisco.

**Parking a car:**
there's some parking (one-hour until 6 pm, except on Sunday) on the street in front of the space, but this may be full. There is also street parking along Connecticut Street.

**Bike parking:**
feel free to bring your bike up the elevator and inside the space.

**Public transit:**
the 19 bus stops around the corner, and the 48 bus stops nearby. If you're coming from the East Bay, one way is to get off at Civic Center BART and take the 19 south.

Here’s what our building looks like! When you turn from Cesar Chavez St. onto Missouri St., it’s the tall grey box with large windows:

The left side of the building has a little tree in front of the main entrance, usually behind a few cars:

![Building closer]({{ "/assets/images/building-closer.jpg" | relative_url }})

That’s the building’s front door. If you’re a guest of a member, or a guest attending a public event, you can use the keypad to press #111 (our unit number) to call the phone inside the space.

### Access

Other than during events open to the public, Double Union visitors must be the invited guest of a member. Please do not visit without the express invitation of a member. Please do not invite guests unless you are a member. Guests may be any gender or age.

We announce public events on [our blog]({{ site.urls.tumblr }}), [public mailing list]({{ site.urls.mailing_list }}), [Facebook]({{ site.urls.facebook }}), [Instagram]({{ site.urls.instagram }}), and on Twitter at [{{ site.twitter_username }}]({{ site.urls.twitter }}).

### Conduct while in the space

Double Union has a strict [anti-harassment policy]({{ 'policies' | absolute_url }}) which all visitors and members are expected to follow at all times. This policy is enforced by all Double Union members.

### Accessibility

The building that Double Union is located in is fully ADA compliant. There is a large elevator to get to the space, and there is an accessible bathroom inside. To access the space, take the elevator to the first floor (1). The upper (loft) area of the space is accessible by elevator (floor 1M).

Double Union is actively working to create a culture where we create and maintain accessible space. We will add more accessibility information as we go on, and would love feedback on how to improve.
