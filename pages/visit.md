### Conduct while in the space

Double Union has a strict [code of conduct]({{ 'policies' | absolute_url }}) which all visitors and members are expected to follow at all times. This policy is enforced by all Double Union members.

### Accessibility

77 Falmouth St is a ground-level retail-style space open to the sidewalk, without stairs or elevators. It is flat inside. It has one ADA-accessible bathroom.

Double Union actively works to create a culture where we create and maintain accessible space.
