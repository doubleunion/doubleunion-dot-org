### Location

Double Union is at [650 Florida St Unit M, San Francisco](https://maps.app.goo.gl/JGSaEzRYWKjqMS3n8), within a courtyard.

It's about 3/4 mile from the Powell BART station and 1 3/4 mile from the 4th & King Caltrain station.

### Access

Other than during events open to the public, Double Union visitors must be the invited guest of a member. Please do not visit without the express invitation of a member. Please do not invite guests unless you are a member. Guests may be any gender or age.

We announce public events on [our blog]({{ site.urls.tumblr }}), [public mailing list]({{ site.urls.mailing_list }}), [Facebook]({{ site.urls.facebook }}), [Instagram]({{ site.urls.instagram }}), and on Twitter at [{{ site.twitter_username }}]({{ site.urls.twitter }}).

### COVID-19 risk mitigation

We have requirements and recommendations to try to make DU relatively safe for most people, and we ask that members and guests follow them. The full [COVID-19 policy is here]({{ 'policies#covid-19-policy' | absolute_url }}). These include:

* Wear a face covering, ideally a high-quality mask (N95, KF94, KN95). If you forget one or want a new one, DU has masks in a cart by the front door.
* Be fully vaccinated.
* [Review basic self-screening questions](https://sf.gov/sites/default/files/2020-08/HealthScreeningQuestions-11x17-081120.pdf) and be able to say "no".
* Increase ventilation as much as you can. Keep the door open if possible, verify that both air purifiers are on, and turn on the fan if needed. Occasionally check the CO2 monitor on the shelf at the back of the room, which should display lower than 800 ppm.

### Accessibility

Our space is a ground-level retail-style space open to the sidewalk, no stairs or steps. It has an ADA-accessible bathroom. The majority of the space is flat inside, and it has a few stairs to additional workspace.

### Conduct while in the space

Double Union has a [code of conduct]({{ 'policies#code-of-conduct' | absolute_url }}) which all visitors and members are expected to follow at all times. This policy is enforced by all Double Union members.
