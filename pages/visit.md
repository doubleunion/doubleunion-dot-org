### Location

We are currently virtual-only! 

When it is safe to gather again, we plan to rent a new space. We intend to reopen in San Francisco or Oakland near a BART station, maintaining our commitment to ADA-compliant (or better) accessibility and a warm and welcoming environment. Our equipment is in storage, and we look forward to unpacking and organizing it again.

For now, we continue to gather online, with chat and videocall communication, events, and workshops.

### Access

Other than during events open to the public, Double Union visitors must be the invited guest of a member. Please do not visit without the express invitation of a member. Please do not invite guests unless you are a member. Guests may be any gender or age.

We announce public events on [our blog]({{ site.urls.tumblr }}), [public mailing list]({{ site.urls.mailing_list }}), [Facebook]({{ site.urls.facebook }}), [Instagram]({{ site.urls.instagram }}), and on Twitter at [{{ site.twitter_username }}]({{ site.urls.twitter }}).

### Conduct while in the space

Double Union has a strict [code of conduct]({{ 'policies' | absolute_url }}) which all visitors and members are expected to follow at all times. This policy is enforced by all Double Union members.

### Accessibility

When Double Union reopens again, we plan to remain fully ADA compliant. We'll add access information when we get there, such as elevator details!

Double Union actively works to create a culture where we create and maintain accessible space.
