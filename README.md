## DU's website

## Development setup

0. Fork the repo (click the Fork button above), and clone your fork to your local machine. [Here's a GitHub tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) about how to do so.

1. Check whether you have ruby 2.1.0 or higher installed by running `ruby --version` in your terminal

2. If you don’t have ruby 2.1.0 or higher installed, follow the instructions [here](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/)

3. Install Bundler (if you don’t have it already installed) 

```
gem install bundler
```

4. Install dependencies 

```
bundle install
```

5. Run the jekyll server 

```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

6. Load up the page in your browser and begin editing! By default the site will run at `localhost:4000`
