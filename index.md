### Double Union is a space for your projects

Things people do in this space include sewing, programming, electronics, screenprinting, fiber arts of all kinds, and zine making.

Fast internet, shared tools, a carefully curated library of books and zines, and discussion spaces make this a great space for working on your projects, learning skills, and meeting new friends.

Double Union is a supportive community for feminist activism. We strive to be intersectional feminists. We center nonbinary people and women who are trans, cis, queer, straight, and not-fitting-into-those-labels.
