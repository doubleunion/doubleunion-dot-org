### Double Union is a space for your projects

Things people do in this space include sewing, programming, electronics, screenprinting, fiber arts of all kinds, and zine making.

Fast internet, shared tools, a carefully curated library of books and zines, and discussion spaces make this a great space for working on your projects, learning skills, and meeting new friends.

Double Union is a supportive community for feminist activism. We strive to be intersectional feminists. We center nonbinary people and women who are trans, cis, intersex, queer, straight, and not-fitting-into-those-labels. Membership is open to all nonbinary people and all women, self-identified. For details about what we mean, see [membership qualifications]({{ 'membership/#membership-qualifications' | absolute_url }}).

### Visiting Double Union: Classes and Events

Double Union is [currently virtual]({{ 'visit' | absolute_url }}). We plan to reopen a physical space when it is safe to gather again, hopefully in 2021.

Other than during events open to the public, Double Union visitors must be the invited guest of a member. Please do not visit without the express invitation of a member. Please do not invite guests unless you are a member. Guests may be any gender or age.
