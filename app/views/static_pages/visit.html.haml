  Here’s what our building looks like! When you turn from Cesar Chavez St. onto Missouri St., it’s the tall grey box with large windows:

  The left side of the building has a little tree in front of an entrance, usually behind a few cars:

  That’s the building’s front door. If you’re a guest of a member, or a guest attending a public event, you can use the keypad to press #111 (our unit number) to call the phone inside the space.

  Other than during events open to the public, Double Union visitors must be
  the invited guest of a member. Please do not visit without the express

  Double Union has a strict #{link_to "anti-harassment policy", policies_path}
  which all visitors and members are expected to follow at all times. This
  policy is enforced by all Double Union members.

%h3 Open house

  Open house events are open to the general public. Visitors do not need an
  invitation from a member to attend an open house, and may be any gender or
  age. We will announce when we start having open houses.

  The building that Double Union is located in is fully ADA compliant. To
