%h2 Support us

%p
  Double Union is supported entirely by donations, membership dues, and
  volunteers. We would love your support for our women-friendly
  makerspace in San Francisco! We hope to serve as a role model and resource
  for other makerspaces and hackerspaces around the world.

%h3 Set up AmazonSmile

%p
  You can also set up #{external_link_to "AmazonSmile", "http://smile.amazon.com/"} to automatically give Double Union 0.5% of the purchase price of your Amazon purchases (with some exceptions). When you visit AmazonSmile, it'll ask you to pick a non-profit organization; you can search for "Double Union".
